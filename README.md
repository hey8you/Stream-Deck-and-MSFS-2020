Stream Deck icons for MS Flight Simulator 2020

My current goal is to have icons of most plane functions. Currently not everything is mapped to keyboard commands in MS Flight Sim 2020. I'm hoping this will change at some point. I also have to work with the limitations of the Stream Deck. so only 2 way switches will work but 3 way or more does not. This will be icons only and not Stream Deck profiles. If I get enough requests for it I will add mine.

Currently I only have lights and autopilot icons for Airbus A320, Boeing 747-8 and Boeing 787-10. This is a weekend project for me so updates will be somewhat slow. If you have a icon you want, let me know I and I will do my best to get it for you on the next update.


UPDATE 9-14-2020

Added new icons: Engine Anti Ice, Wings Anti Ice, Landing gear indicators.

Switching to .ZIP fles.
